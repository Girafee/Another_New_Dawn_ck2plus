Installation:
1. Copy the base files from CK2+ to the documents/PI/CKII/mod folder. Submods are untested but could work alongside.

Installation with new KA files
1. Do the above, but leave out the KAforMultipleMods folder/file as these will be generated.

5. Copy the contents of the titlegen folder (Dynamic Duchies x.xx (version)/info/titlegen files) and let them overwrite the contents of the TitleGenx.x.xx/scripts folder.

5. Check both Dynamic Duchies and the ck2plus mod and click 'Load Data'
